      We are Falkon Robotics, a high school team who’ve been competing and educating all those interested since 2001.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
      We have an open-door policy where there is no minimum attendance, no applications, and no fee to join or participate.
    </p>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
      Our goal is to educate people about STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) in a fun and engaging way.
    </p>
      <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
        We are a global non profit organization with programs in 100+ countries
    </p>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
      We even have  a 501(3)(c) non profit organization! Friends of falkon robotics is a non-profit organization established by previous alumni, dedicated to our mission.
