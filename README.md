    Engineering Expo is a yearly carinval-style event where we open up 
part of our school to allow anyone regardless of financial situation to 
explore STEAM (Science, Technology,Engineering,Art,Math). Our target audience are 
children and parents that want to give their kid an introduction to STEAM. Our event 
has countless booth with most having activities while others being community booths. 

    At the time of making this our team has hosted this event 2 
times and one of the issues that I saw was how some booths got alot more attention 
compared to others along with some people being lost. So my solution to this problem 
is a website similar to the sixflags app to be used so that uses popups to point people
towards the booths that have less attention. My vision for this project is for it to 
be used yearly without fail and eventually for anyone to be able to use it regardless 
of how much coding expierience they have. In a perfect world this project
would allow anyone to use it without changing the code and just the data stored (booths
+ volunteers).
